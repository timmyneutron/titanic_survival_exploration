# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
# Project #0: Titanic Survival Exploration

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. It's a Jupyter notebook, along with supporting Python code, that looks at data from who survived the sinking of the Titanic, and explores a manual decision-tree algorithm for predicting whether or someone survived based on features like sex, age, etc. The goal was to get a predictve accuracy greater than 80%.

## Concepts and Classes
Concepts explored in this project:

  - basic decision tree algorithm
  - pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib Python libraries
  - iPython and Jupyter notebooks

Relevant classes:
  - [Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009)

## Getting Started
To get started:

1. Download/clone the repository
2. To view the finished product, open `Titanic_Survival_Exploration.html` in a web browser
3. To view the Jupyter notebook, it's recommended you install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Once those are installed, navigate to the project root directory and run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.
